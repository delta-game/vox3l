A Voxel Library For [G3N](https://github.com/g3n/engine).

> WARNING: Please don't use this for anything yet; I really don't know what I'm doing. Features will be added preemptively, inefficiently, and extremely naively. Once this gets out of v0.0.0, I'll consider it at least good-enough to dogfood [DELTÎ”](https://github.com/delta-game/delta)... but wait for either this disclaimer to change or like a v1. lol
